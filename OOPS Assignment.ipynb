    "Q.1. What What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "A.1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that structures code using objects, which combine data and behavior. These objects are created from classes, which serve as blueprints defining the attributes and methods an object will have. OOP promotes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to improve code organization and reusability. It allows developers to model real-world entities more intuitively in code. Overall, OOP makes software easier to maintain, scale, and debug."

A class does not hold actual data itself—it provides the structure that objects (instances) will follow. For example, a Car class might define properties like color and speed, and methods like drive() or brake(). Once the class is defined, we can create multiple car objects with different values for the properties."

Instead, Python allows flexibility in method signatures by using techniques such as default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args), and keyword arguments (**kwargs). These features enable a single method to accept different numbers and types of arguments. Though Python doesn't enforce method overloading, we can simulate it by checking the number and type of arguments inside the method. \n"

The method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class, but its implementation differs. Overriding allows the subclass to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method to better suit its needs. This is a key feature of polymorphism, as the subclass method is called when an object of the subclass is used. To override a method in Python, you simply define a method with the same name in the subclass. If the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the overridden version is executed instead of the one from the superclass. Method overriding promotes flexibility and code reuse in OOP."

    "III. Scalability: OOP makes it easier to scale software applications by creating new classes or extending existing ones using inheritance. This facilitates the addition of new features without affecting the entire codebase.\n",

In contrast, a class method, defined with @classmethod, receives the class itself as the first argument (usually named cls) and can access or modify class-level variables, making it useful for factory methods or operations that affect the class as a whole.

    "A.23. Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows different classes to define methods with the same name, and lets objects of those classes be used interchangeably, even if they are instances of different classes. This is made possible through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. When you call the method on an object, Python automatically determines the correct version of the method to invoke based on the object’s class—this is known as dynamic or runtime polymorphism. For example, if a superclass has a method speak(), and two subclasses override it differently, you can loop over a list of superclass references and call speak() on each object, and Python will execute the appropriate method depending on the actual subclass. This promotes code flexibility and reuse by allowing different object types to be treated through a common interface."
